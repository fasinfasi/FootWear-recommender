pdct_61988,Nike,Running,Men,US 10.5,"16,662",120.0,user_473,super nice but heel fits weird,"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede.

pdct_72113,Nike,Basketball,Men,US 11,135,90.0,user_587,Update: Comfy if you can get them on.,I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.

So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. Itâ€™s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that Iâ€™m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didnâ€™t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because itâ€™s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  Itâ€™s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.

Light weight and versatile,"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months Iâ€™ve had these boots and Iâ€™ve really loved them. Theyâ€™ve got a nice tread that Iâ€™m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they donâ€™t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isnâ€™t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if Iâ€™m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when Iâ€™m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like Iâ€™ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, theyâ€™ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, Iâ€™ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when Iâ€™m wearing my summer weight socks, Iâ€™m not get boiling hot feet. So thatâ€™s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to â€œgoâ€ in my work boots.So far, theyâ€™ve been worth the investment!

pdct_86441,Adidas,Lifestyle,Women,US 7,382,130.0,user_388,Best hiking shoe ever,"The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my footâ€™s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If youâ€™re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these â€œtoo smallâ€.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isnâ€™t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary â€œfeet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much Iâ€™m buying a second pair incase theyâ€™re discontinued.",5,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419I5iQvvtL._AC_SY695_.jpg,best hiking shoe ever,the first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fitthey literally fit like a glove snug and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot at first i found them to be too small that is until i realized they just fit closer to my foots natural shape than normal shoes do if youre used to the way american work boots fit extremely large you may find these too small they have a deep heal cup pretty high arch support and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes the soles have fantastic grip on rocks and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that i have found in a shoe i also like that the sole isnt overly wedged forward like a running shoe it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain in fact after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long offtrail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe i found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable the lacing system is pretty normal nothing funky but i will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe giving a momentary feet tied together type fallthis is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrousdeadlyi like these boots so much im buying a second pair incase theyre discontinued,best hiking shoe ever the first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fitthey literally fit like a glove snug and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot at first i found them to be too small that is until i realized they just fit closer to my foots natural shape than normal shoes do if youre used to the way american work boots fit extremely large you may find these too small they have a deep heal cup pretty high arch support and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes the soles have fantastic grip on rocks and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that i have found in a shoe i also like that the sole isnt overly wedged forward like a running shoe it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain in fact after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long offtrail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe i found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable the lacing system is pretty normal nothing funky but i will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe giving a momentary feet tied together type fallthis is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrousdeadlyi like these boots so much im buying a second pair incase theyre discontinued

I purchased these to try them out hoping theyâ€™d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldnâ€™t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i donâ€™t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know theyâ€™re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9â€™s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small.

pdct_42781,Puma,Running,Men,US 8.5,165,100.0,user_286,"Lovely, but...","This shoe is well built, one of the best looking hiking shoes I came across, above average quality and really slick design. It's a bit heavy, but it's a waterproof (GORE-TEX) hiking shoe with thick sole, so it's expected.Unfortunately, did not work for me.  Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable.

I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess.

I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.",4,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41UbbOWinJL._AC_SY625_.jpg,more athletic hiker than the moab s,coming from a moab vent and moab vent user i was a bit skeptical that any other merrell could provide the same comfort but man do these things rocki have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited i originally chose the moab vents because of their outofthebox bangon comfort and fit you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head they were that good as i got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe i started to notice that my moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didnt cinch down enough for my ankles they always felt loose on me going down half a size didnt helpafter my moab s finally cried uncle i looked for a bit more athletic hiker not a trail runner but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint i came across the alverstones and after reading countless reviews i saw the magic words large toebox and great for wide feet i got them delivered and threw them on for a quick miler on varied terrain and i gotta say these are my new hiking shoes the fit is on a another level so much more secure than the moab s and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where i dont feel boxy and like im wearing hiking boots the moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste the quicklacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fastpaced hikes which is what i enjoyi do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out asap especially for someone like me with my foot issues not a problem as i just swapped out the aftermarket insoles i had in my moab sits only been one hike but i love them so far and dont see any issues coming up in the future,more athletic hiker than the moab s coming from a moab vent and moab vent user i was a bit skeptical that any other merrell could provide the same comfort but man do these things rocki have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited i originally chose the moab vents because of their outofthebox bangon comfort and fit you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head they were that good as i got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe i started to notice that my moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didnt cinch down enough for my ankles they always felt loose on me going down half a size didnt helpafter my moab s finally cried uncle i looked for a bit more athletic hiker not a trail runner but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint i came across the alverstones and after reading countless reviews i saw the magic words large toebox and great for wide feet i got them delivered and threw them on for a quick miler on varied terrain and i gotta say these are my new hiking shoes the fit is on a another level so much more secure than the moab s and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where i dont feel boxy and like im wearing hiking boots the moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste the quicklacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fastpaced hikes which is what i enjoyi do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out asap especially for someone like me with my foot issues not a problem as i just swapped out the aftermarket insoles i had in my moab sits only been one hike but i love them so far and dont see any issues coming up in the future
