Nike,Basketball,Men,US 10,"2,242",170,Love em,Love these. Was looking for converses and these were half the price and so uniqueâ€” Iâ€™ve never seen clear shoes like these; they fit great. The plastic takes a little getting used to but the style is so worth it.,5
Adidas,Running,Men,US 9.5,240,180,The plastic ripped,"The shoes are very cute, but after the 2nd day of wearing them the tongue started ripping. After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped. They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work. If youâ€™re going to buy these I donâ€™t recommend wearing them on days where you will do a lot of walking or they might rip",2

Vans,Skate,Women,US 6,60,50,Disappointed,This is the second pair I bought. Loved the first pair however not pleased with the 2nd pair. There is no padding in the tongue part of the shoe and it is causing irritation to my skin where it rubs. I am very disappointed and will not buy them again.,2

Asics,Running,Women,US 8,112,150,Comfortable and attractive,"I have hard to fit feet and often a wide fitting shoe looks too big and bulky.  These shoes were comfortable right away with no pressure points.  I use them for run around shoes, going to the store, etc.  They look casual but are more attractive than a running shoe.  They have a nice rounded toe box and go with any kind of outfit.  I am very happy with them.",5

Adidas,Running,Women,US 8.5,"4,583",140,Great quality and comfort shoes,Great quality and comfort shoesI was so thrilled when I got my new shoes last week! I had bought a pair of a RAVON shoes over two years ago at an expensive shoe store and I did not regret spending the money because they were perfect walking shoes and they gave me plenty of support and I have a bunion on my left big toe and I had plenty of room for that foot. Tmy new ones just like my old pair as far as being comfortable and they keepI got me balanced. By the way my original pair that are 2 1/2 years old are still good but I am using them to mow grass in because I feel safe walking in them. I wanted new ones because I needed some pretty ones that werenâ€™t grungy looking. I am 67And being balanced is ver  important to me. I highly recommend these shoes because of the wonderful quality and comfort and I got them on sale! What a deal so I feel like I won the lottery! Also I neglected to mention they are very classy looking. Very well-made and beautiful and striking.,5
Reebok,Running,Men,US 11,706,120,NO SUPPORT! NOT FOR RUNNING!,I would NOT recommend these for running. They have zero support and I could feel the rocks in the ground through the shoe. They are also shaped really weird. The sole protrudes out in the back all around the heel and makes your foot appear much larger than it should.,1
Converse,Casual,Women,US 7.5,146,65,Not as supportive as I had hoped for.,"These shoes are cute online but in person...not so much.The shoe is super light weight and flimsy feeling.  Because of this, it feels as if there is no support/stability.My partial orthotic fit well into the heel of the shoe.The shoe not only has aqua-colored accents (shoe string eyelets) but also has an aqua liner throughout the shoe. As I was slipping my socked foot into the shoe for the first time, that inner liner sort of bunched up and made the shoe top look distorted. As if the liner pushed forward and down causing the upper portion and toe of the shoe to twist upward.  Not a nice look.  At that point I decided that I didn't want to struggle with getting the shoe on each time.  I'm returning them.",1
Puma,Running,Men,US 9.5,"1,060",80,Great pair of shoes!,"Very comfortable! Absolutely love the look and feel of these shoes. They run slightly too big. But, that doesn't take away from the comfort. I'm not sliding around inside them. I'm able to work in them well and workout in them great. Excellent pair of shoes.",4
Vans,Skate,Women,US 8,"2,076",70,Canâ€™t wear due to Poorly designed insoles,"I like the style and weight of this shoe, just right for wearing all day.  Good quality components.  However, as other reviewers have said, the insole makes wearing these shoes impossible.  The surface of the insoles is some attractive suede fabric which looks like it will be very comfortable.  In fact, the fabric prevents your foot from sliding into the shoe.  I forced my feet in and my toes were uncomfortably turned in on them selves, I could not possibly wear these shoes like that.  I tried stockings and different types of socks with the same difficulty, I just could not push my foot smoothly into the shoe.  Then I tried taking the insole out of another pair of sneakers and putting them in the Aragonâ€™s.  My foot slid right in but when I walked there was no arch support.  Dilemma, should I send them back or go buy 6 or 7 sets of insoles at the drug store to see if any of them will work.  So disappointing.",3
New Balance,Lifestyle,Men,US 10,382,90,Tongue rubs ankles raw,"The tongue is long, stiff, and rough. It rubs my ankles raw.",2
Asics,Running,Women,US 9,216,120,What I was looking for,"I have been trying to find a casual, but not too casual, shoe for work. I wanted an athletic shoe fit in a shoe that doesn't look like an athletic shoe. This is pretty close. It works well with chinos or colored denim. They would not look right with ""dress"" pants, but for business casual, it's good. I'm always between 8 and 8.5. I went with an 8 and they fit perfectly.  I also need good support and these are reasonable. I have another pair of Aravon shoes (mary jane) and they also work well. I think this is good brand.",4
Fila,Fashion,Men,US 8.5,"38,839",75,Not for slippery surfaces/no tread,I thought they were really cute and fit good but after I decided to wear them around for a day I mopped the floor like I Do every day and I almost slipped so the shoes will not be good for me and my lifestyle very slippery pretty much no tread it would be good for walking as long as youâ€™re never honest with Service but I wouldnâ€™t want to take my chances so back to Searching for a new pair of shoes,3
Skechers,Walking,Women,US 7,392,65,but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up ...,"I'd give them 5 stars if it weren't for the fact that the material on the inside of the shoe keeps pulling on my socks, it's not all the time, but it's frequent enough with certain socks that it becomes annoying to have to stop and pull my socks up which find their way down into my shoes after walking for 10-15 min, also the laces don't seem to stay tied, my recommendation is to buy socks that are really snug around your ankles and use a different pair of laces.... besides that, I think the shoes are really cute, love the choice of brown and blue, I think they work well together, also the shoe has pretty good support, I use my own inserts which fit well in the shoe, but like I said if you don't, the original inserts are pretty good",4
Nike,Running,Men,US 9,843,150,Super cuter sneakers.,I bought these as a birthday present for myself. I originally wanted to use them as my new jogging shoes. The tongue of the shoe is just too stiff for that though. I am still happy with the shoes cuz they are super cute. Besides the stiff tongue my only other complaint is they seem a tad larger than my other size tens. I have a little more space than I like to have. Otherwise completely awesome!,5
Adidas,Running,Women,US 7.5,"4,992",170,"Cute, but small","I was so excited to find these shoes. They are super cute!  They were too small, however, and I cannot find the larger size I need.  When I tried them on, they were really stiff and a bit tight.  Who knows maybe they would stretch out as I wore them, but they just didn't fit.  I am disappointed that I can't find the size I need anywhere, but will keep looking.",4
Reebok,Cross-training,Men,US 10,240,130,Nice lightweight comfort shoe,"It's a very comfortable and lightweight shoe.  I found it to be pretty true for a size 10, but all shoes run differently.  Other reviews said it ran small, but I didn't find that the case. I bought the 10D width.  The wider width doesn't look odd, it fits the shoe well and my foot.",5
Converse,Casual,Women,US 9,277,85,Total Comfort,Two years ago I bought this same exact shoes.  I wore them always when choosing a stylish athletic shoe. Originally I bought them when our family was going to go to The Ark in Kentucky and knew we would be doing alot of walking.there has never been a time that my feet hurt when I wear these shoes. And I get compliments often as to how cute they look.  So best shoes for me for comfort and style! Bought them again to update and bought an additional pair in black.,5

Skechers,Walking,Women,US 7.5,112,60,Thank you!,"These shoes are cute and jus fine. I wanted to comment on the company actually. I bought these for a wedding for my son to wear and they werenâ€™t going to arrive in time.  I reached out to Amazon with no luck. I finally contacted the company directly and they said they didnâ€™t think they could get them to me in time because of how the process works. However, I literally received these the very next day. Whoever I spoke to, thank you, you obviously went out of your way to get these pulled and shipped to me and I canâ€™t thank you enough. They made it on time and the wedding was gorgeous!!My son kept the shoes on all night and now wears them when he wants to dress up casual  ..he says they are comfy and shoe laces are long enough he can tie them easily",5
Nike,Casual,Men,US 11,812,90,Not your average skate shoe. Theyâ€™re attractive!,"When my 8 year old asked for â€œskate shoesâ€, I could only picture AirWalks or Vans (which are cute, but donâ€™t fit their wide feet well). I began searching and found these. They are not just skate shoes, but also adorable and good, Adidas quality.",5
Adidas,Running,Women,US 9,317,140,Great shoe - great price - runs big,"Great looking shoe at a great price! I got these in the gray with black stripes and the black with white stripes. Looks exactly like the ones I got from the store that were $20 more. They run big. I wear a womenâ€™s 7 in most shoes. I measured my foot on the big kids Adidas size chart and according to it, I should get a 6.5. I got the 6 because they didnâ€™t have any other sizes and based on other reviews from women I was hoping they would work out. Theyâ€™re big. I measured them against the menâ€™s 7 I had from the store and there wasnâ€™t much difference between the 6 and 7. They measured the same as the menâ€™s 6.5 I had from the store. I wouldâ€™ve ordered a 5 if they were available. Itâ€™s hard to guess with the weird sizing situation. Hopefully putting in some insoles will help because I want to keep them.",5

Skechers,Training,Women,US 9,2,50,Good Quality,This product fits well but may not be ideal for a child that has wide feet.

Asics,Running,Men,US 11,84,170,Sehr gute Winterstiefel!,Mein 4- jÃ¤hriger Sohn liebt diese Stiefel und mÃ¶chte seine anderen Schuhe nicht mehr tragen. Er hat in den Stiefeln keine SchweiÃŸfÃ¼ÃŸe wie in einigen anderen Schuhen. Er lÃ¤uft sehr gut  darin und hat auch bei eisigen Temperaturen keine kalten FÃ¼ÃŸe. Die Stiefel sind meiner Meinung nach von einer sehr guten QualitÃ¤t und deshalb etwas schwerer. Meinen Sohn stÃ¶rt das Ã¼berhaupt nicht. Er kommt perfekt rein und wieder raus (das war bei anderen Stiefeln problematischer). Das Highlight fÃ¼r ihn ist natÃ¼rlich das blinken. Ich werde die Stiefel auch wohl im nÃ¤chsten Winter kaufen.,5
Fila,Casual,Women,US 8.5,"1,795",65,Perfekt auch fÃ¼r etwas breitere KinderfÃ¼ÃŸe,"Beck Gummistiefel begleiten uns nun schon einige Jahre. Passform super, vorallem, wenn die FÃ¼ÃŸe etwas breiter geschnitten sind. Klare Kaufempfehlung. Die Leuchtfunktion beim Gehen ein Highlight fÃ¼r die Kleinen.

Nike,Lifestyle,Women,US 6,"2,144",120,"Robuste, warme Winter-Gummistiefel","Ich habe diese Gummistiefel nun das zweite Mal bestellt, aus den ersten ist mein SÃ¶hnchen herausgewachsen. Die Gummistiefel sind sehr robust: Sie haben ein ganzes Kindergartenjahr vergleichsweise gut Ã¼berstanden! Sie halten warm und trocken. Es stimmt, dass die Stiefel etwas schwerer sind als andere Gummistiefel, aber meinen Sohn hat das nicht gestÃ¶rt oder beim Laufen behindert. Ein paar kleine Kritikpunkte: Die Blinkfunktion hat im Laufe des Jahres den Geist aufgegeben... auch riechen die Stiefel leicht nach Chemie, wenn sie noch ganz neu sind.",5
Adidas,Lifestyle,Men,US 10,12,220,SchÃ¶ner Jungen Stiefel,Die Gummistiefel sind sehr schÃ¶n verarbeitet und unser Sohn liebt sie. Nebst der guten Verarbeitung ist der Leuchteffekt sehr ansprechend und unser Sohn ist gut zu sehen. Der Leuchteffekt bleibt auch bei starker Verschmutzung bestehen und die Schuhe lassen sich sehr gut reinigen.,5
Reebok,Casual,Women,US 7.5,421,65,Gute Wintergummistiefel,"Mein Sohn ist sehr zufrieden. Die Stiefel sind gut verarbeitet und halten im Winter die FÃ¼sse schÃ¶n trocken und warm. Sie sind von innen vollstÃ¤ndig mit einem kuscheligen Kunstfell gefÃ¼ttert und von auÃŸen im ganzen mit durchsichtigem Gummi Ã¼berzogen. Das Dinosaurierskelettmuster ist schÃ¶n und perfekt fÃ¼r alle Dinofans. Die Ferse blinkt beim gehen, was im dunklen Winter nur vom Vorteil sein kann. Der Stiefel fÃ¤llt etwas groÃŸ aus.

Fila,Fashion,Men,US 11,"2,242",65,Quality design has been exchanged for quick profit. Sorry I gotta move on to a new brand.,"I've been buying dan post albuquerque boots for several years now and they have been great until now. They have obviously changed the manufacturing to a much lower quality. I usually plan on buying a pair every year. I use my boots pretty hard in the garage for welding and fabricating and so far the albuquerque has taken the beating gracefully. But as soon as I opened the box for the new pair I immediately noticed the difference in quality. I included pictures of the old boot compared with the new one. The heal used to have layers of leather between the layers of sole material (rubber, plastic, poly-blablabla whatever?) It was tacked in to place and provided a sturdy support. The new boot has a chunk of foam like garbage the same as any pair of cheap garbage boot one could buy at Walmart. But they compensate for it by coloring it to look like layers of leather. I did try them on and they just didn't feel the same. The sturdy support I have come to count on has been replaced by a feeling of cheap low quality design compromises in exchange for quick profit. With a history of plantar fasciitus I just can't take the chance of wearing low quality footwear. Sorry Dan post, I gotta move on.",2
Skechers,Training,Women,US 8.5,240,70,Just a really comfortable Boot..,"I bought these with apprehension having Spine issues and a Spinal Implant Device for Pain. I have been a Wellington and Cowboy type Boot guy for Decades and had to stop wearing because of the high Heel causing lower Back Pain and thought Iâ€™d try the Dan Post due to the Reviews. Iâ€™ve always been a Justin Boot Guy with my first Justin Boots in 1987 but just sent back a pair after wearing them for 5 hours due to Pain and stitches popping on the  Left Boot, Justin has Issues now for some reason. I received my Dan Post today immediately put them on and WOW they are the most comfortable Cowboy Boot Iâ€™ve ever put on my Feet, I went to Walmart and walked for 2 hours and zero Back Pain from a non broken in Cowboy Boot, thatâ€™s unheard of and if youâ€™re a Boot Person you know what Iâ€™m talking about, some discomfort is expected with new Boots. I have a flat kind of wide Foot and wear a 13 tennis shoe and I ordered the 12 EW because they were a lot cheaper and they fit just fine and in fact I could have worn an 11 1/2 and maybe had my Cobbler stretch them if needed. Iâ€™m so happy I snagged these Dan Post Boots and Iâ€™m just amazed at the Comfort Level from this type of Boot, I canâ€™t imagine how Insanely Comfortable the Blayde or the Storm Tide would be with the extra cushion. I did have to put in an Insole due to my Right Boot missing one but it didnâ€™t matter, these are just a quality Comfortable Boot.Semper Fidelis",5
Nike,Running,Men,US 10.5,"16,662",120,super nice but heel fits weird,"These are comfortable and cushy in the foot. The toe box is narrow at first but you can use a cedar shoe tree to make room in the toes, to open the toe area for a better fit.  I wear a women's 8.5 and the men's size 7 fit well w/ an added 3/4 insert to fill up the space in the heels and add support. These would be great for winter, with the sturdy rubber soles with tread, and warm lining. But the heels were placed at an odd angle on these, so that I kept rocking back on the heels.  I put them on a table and saw the heels do not sit flush on a flat surface. This caused the front part of the heel to dig into the bottom of my foot when wearing, and I was constantly rocking back on the heels.I think this was a defect, so returned them. I read reviews that they now make these with a cheaper 'brushed or suede' type leather,  in the past they were made with a smooth leather, so the boots are no longer an ""oily brown"" as described, but more a reddish brown suede.  I noticed the boots suede leather wrinkled quickly just in trying them on, and I was not nuts about that. One way to fix that is to apply mink oil or red wing leather cream, and this smooths out the nap so they have a smooth leather finish and not suede. Boot manufacturers are swapping out this 'nappy brushed leather or suede' for real smooth leather on many boots, b/c it must be cheaper. Sad b/c the smooth leather looks better and wears longer.",4
Nike,Basketball,Men,US 11,135,90,Update: Comfy if you can get them on.,I read a review before buying these where the guy noted that he had difficulty getting his heal down into the boot and as a result the fabric at he bottom of the shaft and the top of the heal cup tore.  Dan Post apparently fixed that problem buy adding a leather reenforcement. When I first put them on the left one went on fine but with the right one I had a good deal of difficulty getting my heal past the leather patch and into the heal cup.  It has gotten progressively worse until now I can not get the right one on no matter how hard I try.  Perhaps a boot horn would help but...anyway great boots if you can get them on. Very comfortable.  Not sure what to do at this point...So I contacted amazon and I am returning the original pair.  They sent out a new pair. This is an entirely different boot.  They are at least 1/2 too small.  MUCH narrower especially when viewed form the bottom. The sole is 1/2 narrower.  The Dan Post Tag is a different color (green and yellow as opposed to the black and gold of the original).  The heal seems higher.  Leather is inferior. Weird.  I called Dan Post and they said they are always making design changes.  Looks like I'm just going to get my money back.  Too bad.,2
Adidas,Fashion,Men,US 9,240,220,"If You're Considering These Boots, BUY THEM!","I've owned over 10 pairs of Dan Post boots. Yes, I'm a big fan of them. I enjoy wearing Western-styled clothes and boots. I'm also a truck driver, and a biker. These boots fit the bill for all of these. Right out of the box, they look great, and are very comfortable. I wear a 12D. I ordered a 12D, and the fit is spot on. No problems at the heel, arch, or toe. They're listed as Waterproof. Haven't put that to the test yet. They're not as heavy as I thought they'd be. Very nice boot, easy to get used to, and looks great. I gave them a good treatment of Leather Honey, to condition the leather, and give them some extra protection. All in all, a great boot. I have no issues with them. They're Dan Post boots---great boots, great quality, and great looks. As I titled this review, if you're considering these boots, buy them. A great all around boot. Lastly, I've read reviews, mentioning that they're made in China. Yes, unfortunately, mine say it, too. Really sad.",5
Reebok,Training,Men,US 10,455,130,Best Pair Of Boots I've Ever Owned - Seam plastic piping is the weak point,"I've owned these boots for two years and have worn them nearly every day.  From mud to motorcycles in the snow and rain, these boots have done all I've asked and more.  In fact they're still going and I can't stand not wear them because they're incredibly comfortable and just get better looking the more beat up they get.  I like them so much that I just bought a new pair to replace them only because the side seams and piping are starting to blow out and the sole of the heal is ready to hit leather.  I would have them resoled if it were not for the seam coming apart.I've given them 4 stars only because of the seam and piping but the fact that I bought another identical pair tells you that 4 stars is a great rating for me.The only time I don't wear these boots is when I'm working-out or I'm hiking.  Otherwise I wear them everywhere from business travel to working in the field.Pros:The fit is dead on at 9DComfort is excellentWaterproofing is excellentDurability is excellentLooks are excellentCon: The plastic piping and seams come apart before the rest of the boot is worn out. That's the only weak point and I think it's the piping that causes the failure.",4

New Balance,Casual,Women,US 7,206,80,Uncomfortable and stiff fitting shoe,"I have worn New Balance shoes for 10+ years now.  I started with New Balance WX1011 and WX1012 Cross trainers for tennis based on recommendation from my local New Balance specialty shop.  WX 1011 and 1012 were light weight mesh, flexible with good lateral support and soles that were not too stiff.  As a replacement shoe, New Balance recommended this 966v3 shoe. This is one of the most uncomfortable shoes I have tried on.  It is stiff, it presses across the toes and causes pain and the soles are too thick and stiff for quick movement on the tennis court.",1
Asics,Running,Men,US 11,954,120,Good overall fit,"Comfortable fit except for the area at the top lace hole. It is very stiff and rests on the inner ankle bone which causes rubbing and discomfort. Tried tieing at a lower hole but still rubs. Once I figure out how to alleviate this problem I will be happy. Hope in time, it will loosen up.",3
Fila,Fashion,Women,US 8,860,65,Small shoes that pinch in the forefoot,"As mentioned by others, these shoes not only run small but they pinch in the forefoot. Also, the ""fit and finish"" of these shoes is highly disappointing -  the way the tongue is sewn into the shoe leaves a lot to be desired and the extra fabric inside the shoe rubs your feet. Finally, the plastic edge where the lace holes sit is extremely rigid and this same plastic edge also affects the front of your foot when tied.Am definitely returning and looking for a better solution.",2
Skechers,Running,Women,US 7.5,102,90,Not Good,"These are very uncomfortable sneakers.  I bought them a while  ago and thought they just needed more time to break in.  Months later, still feel stiff, heavy, and has some plastic pieces that dig in some spots.  Will have to get rid of these.",1
Nike,Running,Men,US 10,116,130,Sizing,I loved the colors but sizing runs small. I wear a size 11 normally and was trying to find a wider pair of shoes. These are very tight on my foot and Iâ€™m hoping they stretch out a bit when worn in.,4
Adidas,Running,Women,US 6.5,198,120,Width not as advertised.,"When I ordered these, the website said 6.5 Medium but at checkout it said 6.5 D. I called Amazon & they said these were 6.5 Medium. They arrived & the box said 6.5 D. Thatâ€™s too wide for me so I returned them. I have other New Balance tennis shoes that are 6.5B. Iâ€™m grateful shipping & return were free. Nice looking shoe.",1

Converse,Casual,Women,US 8.5,557,110,Not original Product. How people giving positive rating? might be kind of cheating.,"it is not original product, Replica of New Balance shoe..I really wonder and so very about India, why this much cheating and corruption happening India.I can see some places of shoe no stitches. Some place of shoe not sticked with glue very very very pooor product.",1
Puma,Casual,Men,US 11,63,80,Shoe quality not upto mark,"New balance is a recognized brand for sports shoes, this particular shoe is branded as running shoes. I had purchased this shoe in 18 Dec 2020 & I am not able to use it anymore, due to the damage to the heel area. Within 2 months of use the area near my toe got damaged & I had to get leather patch glued to it (from inside) to prevent further damage (clearly visible on both shoes).Within 4 months heel support area got worn out (refer picture) causing pain in heel.For the price, this shoe should have lasted 2 years, but it did not last 4 months.I run / walk average of 5 to 8 km daily, normally my shoes last over 5 years, but I was expecting this shoe to last at least 2 years.",1
Vans,Skate,Women,US 7,2,55,Do not buy this,The got this shoe for just 1100 however the quality was not very good and fitting was also very tight. The inside sole and upper of shoe doesn't feel to be of high quality and looks like it won't last longer than 3-4 months. After seeing the shoe i returned it and would not recommend you to buy this particular shoe from New Balance.,3
New Balance,Running,Men,US 10.5,"2,242",175,U Get What U Pay For,"You get what u pay for. Decent for the price. Very basic shoe. If you want a neutral shoe which u can use for commute as sneaker and use it for ocassional short distance run then it might suit u. Cushioning is provided by fresh foam which is decent but not as plush. Not much of a tech goes into it. Like it doesn't have hard plate in mid sole which keeps ur midfoot stable or say solid heel lock is missing. No extra layers of protection, in terms of cushioning in the sole. Laces are just basic. Build quality is ok but not great. Not suitable for broad feet. Decent but I think Asics Gel Nimbus and Mizuno Waverider are miles ahead of it in terms of neutral road running shoe. Waverider 19 is still the most value for money product here in India. Gel Nimbus are bit expensive. If u still wanna stuck with NB better look for Fresh Foam 1080 V or 880 V.",2
Asics,Running,Women,US 9,240,160,the best of New Balance!,"Fitting is perfect (i have ordered one size up). Light weight but the sole and quality of the product is good.

Skechers,Walking,Men,US 9,245,65,Too small,They were way too thin on my feet,1
Nike,Running,Women,US 8,60,160,Poorly uneven fit.,"Maybe itâ€™s just this color way but the fit is TERRIBLE. Itâ€™s tight mid-foot because of some band on the top but itâ€™s actually loose in the toe box. When shoes fit this bad, I just can not recommend them for anything. Not for basketball, not for working out, not even for walking. Adidas is a great brand but they made a mistake with these shoes. I can only see them working if you have overly narrow feet and you size down them.",1
Adidas,Casual,Men,US 8.5,173,85,almost zero cushioning- what you see is not what you get,"First, these are good looking shoes, they fit pretty well, and the sole has pretty good grip.  What is extremely disappointing is the cushioning level.  What you see on the side of the shoe is not at all what is actually in the sole cushion.  I was looking forward to the Boost cushioning.  Instead, what you get appears to be less than a 1/4 inch of cushioning.  After playing a few games on a hard court, my knees were extremely sore.  All the cushioning you see around the heel is window dressing.  I would not recommend to anyone who values their joints.",1
Reebok,Crossfit,Women,US 7,112,130,Great Cushioning & My New Favorite!,"These shoes are awesome and are my new favorites. The Adidas ""boost"" on these are the best cushion I've ever felt to date. They feel really good when walking or running because you can feel the energy returned to your feet from the boost cushion. I want these shoes in a couple of different color-ways and the 3/4 or high top versions. I like the various different textiles/textures. The thick collar around the ankle & achilles looks kinda weird, but I'm used to it & like it now. Kudos to the design team, I would love to see how this shoe was made & put together. ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ‘ðŸ¾ðŸ˜ŽâœŒðŸ¿",4
Converse,Casual,Women,US 9,"1,490",100,Beautiful Sneaker but impossibly narrow.,I have worn a 10 D my whole life. These shoes were so narrow I could not get my feet in them. Unless you have a narrow foot I would advise against them,3
Puma,Lifestyle,Men,US 10,"6,159",120,look elsewhere. Adidas no help,gots no soul...grip too slick on indoor courts after only 4-5 wears.  The cushioning is pretty decent but shoes are worthless due to the slickness.  Adidas support was no help other than to suggest giving to a friend. I'm offering it to my enemies instead.

Reebok,Training,Women,US 8.5,"1,795",130,Absolutely love them!,"Ok, so normally New Balance shoes run a little small. My normal running shoes are Asics Gel Kayano 11.5 4E width. That is my absolute standard when it comes to fit and feel.When I usually purchase New Balance shoes, I get size 12 4E. Even then, its can be slightly short, but tolerable.  With these shoes, I started with the 12 4E. But man do they run long. The width seemed to be pretty accurate though.So I went with the 11.5 4E instead. They fit almost perfectly, except MAYBE a little long in the toes. However, I believe it were a size down, it would be a little too short.These are absolutely awesome on outdoor pickleball courts. I've easily put on about 20 hours of play on them, and they barely have any wear. I HIGHLY recommend and love them so much, I actually have a 2nd pair as backup.",5
Converse,Casual,Men,US 11,309,75,SIZE IS MISLEADING,"New Balance shoes are the only shoes I wear.  I own about 15 pair.  Always 8 1/2 to 9D.  This is much narrower than all my other shoes, right about where the arch is.  New Balance really screwed up here.  Long time buyers used to be able to find the newer model of a pair of shoes that they like but not any more.  I wish somebody at New Balance would listen to their customers.",2
Puma,Running,Men,US 10,"2,144",90,Width is accurate compared to the 1006,"I wore 1004 4e, 1005 4e. Once NB made the 1006 the toe width got narrow.

Iâ€™m editing because after 6 weeks these shoes are not durable.",2
Vans,Skate,Women,US 7,12,65,One of the Best Court Shoes I've found,"I play ALOT of pickleball and platform tennis. Both are tough on shoes. Time will tell about the durability. But from a fit, weight, and mobility standpoint,  these IMO are best in class. I've tried several major brands and the umpteen different models they offer. I even tried other New Balance models.

New Balance,Lifestyle,Men,US 8.5,421,90,4E too narrrow/low for my foot issues,"Attractive style but too narrow and low for my wide, high instep, hammer toed feet. They killed my hammer toe.

Vans,Casual,Women,US 8,"4,583",50,"Lightweight, supportive, waterproof - LOVE!!","After measuring my foot, following the size chart and ordering a 7, I could barely fit my foot in the shoe. Turns out I have an incredibly high instep, so I went a full size up to the 8. Fit like a glove! The arch support was in just the right spot - I've NEVER felt so supported by any boot before, hiking or otherwise. There is comfortable padding on the ankle, so no worry abt clipping a rock and having it knock your bone. Also the weight of these boots is incredible. SO LIGHT!!! I feel like I'm wearing sneakers.The other day I took them for a ""test walk"" through a local stream, and while I stayed mostly on the sandy/muddy bank, I did occasionally walk through the water to see how the waterproofness held up. EXCELLENT! I could feel the coolness of the water but my socks stayed 100% dry.I've gotten lots of compliments already and they are by far the coolest looking hiking boots I've owned. I love that the design is not TOO overly ""outdoorsy"" looking and doesn't have a lot of extra straps in the design (ie. keen or LL Bean  boots).Buy these boots and you won't be sorry!!",5
New Balance,Running,Men,US 12,706,150,Avoid buying the boots on Amazon!  Maybe avoid in general!!!,"Donâ€™t waste your time with these.  So I bought the boots in October of 2019.  Yes they are very comfortable and light, but my boots tore right  where the black part of the bottom seams to the shoe. Itâ€™s the area where the foot would flex as you step.  I contacted Vasque Red Wing and they told me they offer a 12 month warranty on any manufacturer defects. Sounds great! They told me they have a defect contract with Amazon to take care of this.  So I then reach out to amazon and they tell me that Iâ€™m past my 30 days and that they would pro rate me part of the refund and I would keep the boots and get them fixed myself. Sounds great, but that didnâ€™t happen either, they send me a return label and will refund me 80% of the boot value because itâ€™s considered a late return.  Failure from both companies. The 12 month warranty means nothing from Vasque and Amazon did nothing to help. My suggestion is to buy directly from a retailer. Then you may have a chance with the boot warranty.  Itâ€™s a tough pill to swallow for 4 month old boots that are $100+.Update:1/30/2020-  apparently Vasque is having issues with Amazon honoring their 12month defect contract.  Once I got this through for Vasque to understand, they offered me a replacement pair of boots, making good with their warranty.  It was a fight, but I am getting new boots from the manufacturer.",1
Asics,Running,Women,US 9,146,150,Great shoe but runs very small!,"Just received bought the eggplant I love this show. Not hiked in it yet though. It has a high arch support, and a padded super comfy heap. So for people with heal pain great shoe. My normal size is 8.5, I ordered a 9 based on reviews that it runs small. Well I now need a 9.5 so asking seller if they will exchange. This is not a shoe for a wide footed person but if you are a regular Vasque purchaser you will know that. I would have given 5 stars but for the hassle of having to exchange and hope I donâ€™t get charged extra because shoe runs small!",4
Fila,Fashion,Men,US 9.5,"1,060",75,Great for farming. Light weight and versatile,"I am a full time vegetable farmer and my shoes have to go through some serious work throughout the season! For the past three months Iâ€™ve had these boots and Iâ€™ve really loved them. Theyâ€™ve got a nice tread that Iâ€™m kept quite stable walking on rough terrain all day, but they donâ€™t cake quite so heavily with mud when I am working in wet soil.Like any boot that isnâ€™t a rubber rain boot, they will get moist in the inside if Iâ€™m really soaking them in puddles and such, but on wet mornings they stay quite dry when Iâ€™m walking through dewy grass. I still usually wear Muck boots in those conditions though.The best thing about these boots is their weight and flexibility. My feet and legs really enjoy the sneaker-like feel to these and I can wear them all day and not feel like Iâ€™ve got lead weights on my feet. Additionally, theyâ€™ve been super easy to hose off at the end of the day.Finally, Iâ€™ve been working in 90+ degree days in these and when Iâ€™m wearing my summer weight socks, Iâ€™m not get boiling hot feet. So thatâ€™s a huge plus.Just remember to size up! I was worried that even when I sized up they were a little snug around the edges of my feet (my feet are a relatively normal width, maybe a tiny bit wide), but after even a day of wearing them, they stretched out some and are my favorite farming boot to date!For reference, I typically am walking 3-5 miles a day on the farm and doing lots of bending and crouching. I have yet to see indications of wear at the crease points near the base of my toes from crouching, which is always the first place to â€œgoâ€ in my work boots.So far, theyâ€™ve been worth the investment! We will see in a few months how they actually hold up to eastern PA farming.",4
Nike,Running,Men,US 8.5,"2,076",120,"Beautiful, well-made, but 100% FLAWED for hiking!","I want to love these shoes, but there's one MAJOR flaw with the design of these shoes witch make these a dealbreaker for me. I've been hiking for years, and I know from experience this design flaw puts you at higher risk for a sprained or broken ankle.  The tread on the sole around the back outside of the shoe does not extend to the edge, which means, when you lean your anke to the side, there is a point at which the shoe will buckle for lack of support, and you're going down! All that time an money for product development, I'm surprised that this got overlooked. It's a bummer, because these would otherwise be great shoes! If you want an expensive pair of comfortable rugged shoes for walking on flat surfaces, then these would be fine.",2
Adidas,Lifestyle,Women,US 7,382,130,Best hiking shoe ever,"The first thing to get out of the way with these unusual but incredibly awesome hiking boots is the fit...they literally fit like a glove - snug, and almost unsettling close to the actual shape of my foot.  At first I found them to be too small, that is until I realized they just fit closer to my footâ€™s natural shape than normal shoes do.  If youâ€™re used to the way American work boots fit (extremely large) you may find these â€œtoo smallâ€.  They have a deep heal cup, pretty high arch support, and a slightly more square toe box than normal shoes.  The soles have fantastic grip on rocks, and are pretty much the best combination of cushion without being too vague or soft that I have found in a shoe.  I also like that the sole isnâ€™t overly wedged forward like a running shoe, it gives these boots a really planted feeling in rough terrain.  In fact, after wearing these boots for a couple consecutive long off-trail hikes and then switching to a more normal running shoe, I found it surprisingly difficult to keep my footing in the running shoes, which made me realize how great these boots are at keeping my feet stable.  The lacing system is pretty normal, nothing funky, but I will say that the all black and two military looking colors seem to be the only 3 versions with captive upper eyelets instead of hooks - in my opinion the hooks can be dangerous if not lethal by accidentally snagging the laces from the opposite shoe (giving a momentary â€œfeet tied together type fall)...this is especially dangerous if you plan to be climbing around rocks or in areas where a fall could be disastrous/deadly.I like these boots so much Iâ€™m buying a second pair incase theyâ€™re discontinued.",5
Reebok,Crossfit,Men,US 9,216,130,"Not a boot, it is a overly flexible shoe...","I have been using Vasque boots for over 20 years with great satisfaction.  Specially the Breeze series that is an exceptional combination between comfort, support and lightweight for hiking in hot weather.These shoes are exceptionally light but offer almost no support.  They are fresh foam based and overly flexible.  I am very disappointed and recommend not buying this product even to walk in the city, let alone for a trail...",2
Converse,Basketball,Women,US 9.5,"38,839",110,Great!,"I read the reviews about the tightness. I don't have wide feet. I wear thick socks too. I went a 1/2 size up like you should on hiking boots. They did seem snug at first but I wore around the house and decided to give them a try. I'm so glad I did. I either got used to them or they did seem to break without discomfort. That first time I realized I could run in them too!. I use these to run on hiking trails and my feet and legs don't get tired. I love these boots/trail runners. FYI, they have a 6mm heel to toe drop.",5
Puma,Casual,Men,US 11,392,65,Four Stars,"They are cute and very nicely made, but I can't get comfortable in them.",4
Vans,Skate,Women,US 7.5,843,65,"Amazing, so happy","Iâ€™m a plain clothes police officer and I was looking for comfortable, good looking, daily wear all weather boots. I purchased these to try them out hoping theyâ€™d work out. The first day I wore them, I spent 5 hours on my feet at the range  wearing a gun belt and armor, in wet grass and the temperature was around 40 deg F. They were perfect...I couldnâ€™t believe how good they get over the course of the training. I then wore them another 8 or so hours afterwards both during and after work. Overall, these boots are incredibly light, very good arch support, excellent traction, adequate in keeping feet warm during cool temps and all around cushioned enough to be incredibly comfortable during just about any activity. i donâ€™t have any experience with these types of boots, mine is limited to those of the tactical boot variety such as the Adidas GsG9 (original), Blackhawk, Oakley, Viktos, Nike (FSB), and my last were Solomon. These blow them all away in the comfort department, though I know theyâ€™re not very comparable. My only advice is I run between an 8.5 and a 9, I bought 9â€™s, which fit me perfectly but that leads me to believe these run just a tad small. The difference may be negligible to most, but figured Iâ€™d mention it. I love wearing these and didnâ€™t realize there were boots out there quite this comfortable.*UPDATE*2 months in of almost daily wear, multiple outdoor range dates, 4 days straight of outdoor training at 8 hrs per day on my feet. These boots are absolutely outstanding, so comfortable, supportive and waterproof...my only gripe is the treads are so good that itâ€™s a little hard to get the mud and grass out of them afterwards...",5

Asics,Running,Women,US 8.5,240,150,Amazingly comfortable!,"I love these hikers! They are extremely comfortable. I received them the day before my hiking trip and wore them to break them in, they were perfect. I wore them for about nine hours the next day and never felt more comfort. They were comfortable around foot, gave a little bounce back when I walked and great ankle support. I will say if you have a wider foot, this is not for you. I have a narrow to medium foot and at first was afraid of the snugness, but I was able to wear a thick hiking sock and it was fine. I would highly recommend these and will be purchasing more.",5

Puma,Running,Men,US 8.5,165,100,"Lovely, but...","This shoe is well built, one of the best looking hiking shoes I came across, above average quality and really slick design. It's a bit heavy, but it's a waterproof (GORE-TEX) hiking shoe with thick sole, so it's expected.Unfortunately, did not work for me.  Going half size up was a good decision, but the shoe feels tight around the arch, and quite rigid around the inner part of the ankle which makes it really uncomfortable. To add insult to injury (no pun intended, although I can easily imagine injuries at pressure points after long hikes), it really cuts bad into the foot just proximal to the toes, and only one shoe. Virtually impossible to walk without discomfort. Sadly, no matter how much I liked them, had to return.",3

Adidas,Lifestyle,Women,US 8.5,557,140,"Terrible unadjustable, fixed laces!","These sneakers are attractive, lightweight, and the overall construction seems good. I appreciate how the entire sole is rubber and not mostly foam like other kids' sneakers. The sizing (like other sneaker companies) is strange. I usually purchase one or two sizes bigger than what my kids wear in most other shoes. My kids also gravitate to the ""wide"" width even though they don't have wide feet. Those last two things are specific to my kids and how they fit in the sneakers, but once I figured these out, we were set.The reason for the 3 star rating: After cutting the tag off these sneakers and discarding the box when my son gave them the thumbs up, I realized the laces are FIXED and UNADJUSTABLE. There is no way to loosen or tighten them because the tops of the laces are glued to the shoe!After wearing them for a couple days, my son commented on how loose they felt. The elastic is not hefty and they already started to lose elasticity. It would not take much time for them to become way too loose.Finally, I had no choice but to cut the elastic laces out and replace them with different laces. It was still problematic because the top hole (where the original ones were glued) was unusable for the new laces. The sneakers are still somewhat loose because my son can't lace and cinch the new laces as high as he should be able to.Bottom line: these sneakers turned out to be a mess. I've been pleased with New Balance in the past and will continue to purchase their products. BUT, I will absolutely make sure I never purchase sneakers with unadjustable, fixed laces again!",3

My son has fairly narrow feet but after wearing these 1 or 2 times he told me they weren't comfortable and pointed to the end of the 'laces' as hurting.I believe the problem is that the elastic ""laces"" don't adjust very much.  I was able to pull the elastic out there and make a little bit of an adjustment so hopefully we can get SOME wear out of them...wish I could return them though.If your child has wider feet, as mine always have been, you shouldn't even consider this product.",2

Nike,Running,Men,US 10,60,250,Good shoe ... added an insole.,"Good looking shoe. The cloud foam cushion it came with took me about five minutes to dislike because your toes roll over the edges and thatâ€™s soooo annoying. But determined to want to keep them because they are attractive and slip on (I wanted them for a work from home house shoe.) I put a pair of Dr. Scholls in soles inside them. Theyâ€™d been in an old pair of sneakers so I could easily give that a try and let me tell you ... it worked splendidly!! I now LOVE these shoes. They are like walking on marshmallows. True to size. Attractive. Super comfy. Downside is that I ran an errand the first day I had them and something was poking me in the foot so I looked and an earring without a back had picked completely through the cheap sole. Not a huge big deal but worth mentioning. Iâ€™d say if youâ€™re looking for a â€œhouse slipperâ€ quality shoe ... this is it. Throw in a pair of insoles and they work great. Without the insoles, I would have had to return them.",3
Adidas,Fashion,Women,US 7.5,173,220,Not a fan,I really dont like these. They fit strange and are not comfortable. I have several pairs of sneaker type shoes for work and these are at the very bottom of my rotation to wear. Wish i had just gone to kohls or something to try before i bought them.

Reebok,Casual,Men,US 11.5,112,90,Comfy From Day One for My Hard to Fit Feet,"I bought these shoes for casual, comfy days.  Do I plan on running in these?  No.  In all fairness, I probably wouldnâ€™t run in any shoes (unless I was being chased by a predator or running for the last bar of chocolate on earth).  These shoes were instantly comfortable. I wear a 9-9.5.  The ball part of my foot is med to wide; the heel of my foot is narrow. These work great.  I ordered 9.5 and these are true to size. They have a slight stretch in toe box to accommodate width. I can tied the securely so the heel fits. I love the cushy memory foam. I plan on wearing these at Disney, they are that comfortable.  They look pretty good. If I survive walking 5-10 miles at Disney, I will come back and update my post Disney experience. If I donâ€™t survive, it probably was no fault of these shoes. Iâ€™d say one too many ice creams or getting into deadly fight triggered by one too many renditions of â€œItâ€™s a Small World.â€",5

Vans,Skate,Men,US 9.5,843,70,More athletic Hiker than the Moab 2s,"Coming from a Moab Vent and Moab 2 Vent user, I was a bit skeptical that any other Merrell could provide the same comfort, but man do these things rock!.I have wide and flat feet so my shoe choices are somewhat limited. I originally chose the Moab Vents because of their out-of-the-box bang-on comfort and fit (you could buy those at the store and head directly to the trail head, they were that good). As I got more educated on what makes a good hiking shoe, I started to notice that my Moabs were a little too stiff and honestly didn't cinch down enough for my ankles (They always felt loose on me, going down half a size didn't help).After my Moab 2s finally cried Uncle, I looked for a bit more athletic hiker, not a Trail Runner, but something more streamlined with a bit less of a profile and footprint. I came across the Alverstones and after reading countless reviews, I saw the magic words, ""Large Toebox"" and ""Great for wide feet"". I got them delivered and threw them on for a quick 3-miler on varied terrain, and I gotta say these are my new hiking shoes. The fit is on a another level, so much more secure than the Moab 2s, and the footprint is just streamlined enough to where I don't feel boxy and like I'm wearing hiking boots (The Moab footprint was a bit too big for my taste). The quick-lacing system cinches down securely and the design of the tread allows for fast-paced hikes, which is what I enjoy.I do agree with others that the insole needs to be swapped out ASAP, especially for someone like me with my foot issues, not a problem as I just swapped out the aftermarket insoles I had in my Moab 2s.It's only been one hike, but I love them so far and don't see any issues coming up in the future.",4
New Balance,Running,Women,US 7.5,"4,992",165,Less than 100 miles and threads are coming out,"The threads are showing on both toe covers in under 100 miles.  I've been walking everyday in these shoes for just under 4 weeks, which I average about 3 to 4 miles per day.  I probably have about 80 - 90 miles of mostly neighborhood walking with very little trail exposure.I'm filing a defect return with Merrell and will have to see how this goes.As for the fit, I initially struggled with trying to like these, as these are slightly wider than my prior Merrells.  I'm an 11W, and I really have to pull the laces tight to get the right fit, but I've been satisfied with comfort after the first day.The first 1 mile I had these on I was very doubtful.  One foot felt off centered, the other ankle lace was digging into my skin.  However, after taking the shoes completely off and checking my socks the soles and lacing up again, I've been happy every since.  So, don't be completely discouraged by first impressions, it may just take a little adjusting.",1
Asics,Running,Men,US 9.5,240,120,Not a shoe everyone would like but perfect for my feet,"First I want to say that I am a woman and I buy men's shoes to get the width I need.  I have a neuroma in one foot and a fibroma in the other, along with high arches.  I need very wide shoes and lots of cushioning.  I purchased 4 pairs of Merrell hiking shoes at the same time, and this pair is the only one that was comfortable for me, so the others were returned.  I tried Moab 2 Vent in 2 widths, and Moab Edge 2.  I wear a size 8 to 8.5 in women's shoes, mostly wearing wide shoes like Altra and Crocs.  In a men's shoe I go down 1 to 1.5 sizes.  In this shoe a men's 7 wide was perfect.  No, you won't get the Vibram sole, but comfort was more important to me than the sole material.",5
Fila,Hiking,Women,US 9.5,277,70,Don't waste your money!,"Total disappointment; you certainly don't get what you pay for ($80.00) with these.  Merrell is supposed to be a good name with a good reputation for quality shoes, but unfortunately it hasn't been my experience with the last to pairs of hiking shoes I've purchased of theirs.I had these barely 4 months and both heels already had holes worn through the sole.  See attached pics.  Merrell minimizing material costs by reducing the thickness of the sole is just unacceptable for an $80.00 shoe.I certainly won't be purchasing Merrell any longer....Columbia are on my radar now.",1
Skechers,Running,Men,US 8.5,350,70,Great shoe but size seems smaller that usual.,"Delivery was on time and no damages. As with all the other Merrell footwear I have purchased, these shoes are of the quality I expect from them. This is first time I have ordered Merrell products on Amazon, so not sure if that is the reason for my issue. I order 10.5 US from Merrell for all my hiking and general purpose shoes, but these seem about half an inch shorter in length than all my other 10.5 Merrell shoes. And I found out that Merrell lowered their price of this shoe to $80 - so I did not save any money by buying from Amazon! Lesson learned! I will NOT be purchasing footwear from Amazon in the future. I paid the same on Amazon as Merrell's website, and the fit is not the same as I expect. Tried to save a few dollars and screwed myself.",4
Nike,Running,Women,US 6.5,682,120,Happy with my first pair of Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes,"I have had a pair of Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes that I use almost daily for my walking regiment and I have also used them twice walking sections of the Appalacian Trial and they have worn like iron. The only place they have shown much wear is the back of the shoe at the heel. I have had my Merrell Moab hiking shoes for over four years and they don't look too bad for ""old hiking shoes"" but because I have used them more lately for mowing the yard and working in my garden they just aren't ""pristine"" looking enough for wearing to outdoor picnics, parties, and eating out with my wife. I saw the Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes and liked the way they looked and the good price for them so I figured is they were anyway as good as the Merrell Moab Hiking Shoes I would be happy with them. So far I really like my new Merrell Alverstone Hiking Shoes. The fit was good right out of the box and I have had no problems doing by 1.5 to 2 mile daily walks with them. It's like they were already ""broken-in"" and I don't get any blisters or sore areas on my feet or heels from using them new right out of the box.",5
Adidas,Casual,Men,US 11,"3,532",80,About half size smaller the actual size and too narrow,"Updating my review (below) after I've been wearing these shoes for about two weeks.In addition to being smaller than the actual size and too narrow, they do not have much cushioning, which causes some heel pain after a long walk. I would return them but my guess it is too late.Previous review:These are indeed fine-looking shoes, comfortable and cushy. Hopefully, they will serve me well.On the downside, they are not exactly true to size: size 11 actually feels like 10.5. Also, they are moderately uneven: left shoe looks somewhat narrower and slightly curved toward the inside.",3

Tried them hoping to get a good pair of Merrills for less then what I was used to spending.  I regret the decision. While they fit well enough, and have plenty of space. They don't provide the same support. 2 months in and my feet hurt walking in them for extended periods of time. It took my last pair of moabs well over a year to get to this point.  Unfortunately I'll end up buying a new pair of shoes much sooner then expected because I tried to save a few bucks.",3

Adidas,Fashion,Women,US 8.5,998,220,Ein klasse Laufschuh von Brooks - vom Daily Trainer bis zum Wettkampfschuh,"Ich habe inzwischen 150km im Hyperion Tempo absolviert. Vom 7km Fartlek, 10km Tempoeinheit und dem HM in 75% Pace - der Hyperion Tempo macht eine super Figur. Das Zusammenspiel von DÃ¤mpfung, Direktheit und Leichtigkeit ist aus meiner Sicht hervorragend. Doch der Reihe nach:Gewicht: Der Schuh ist nicht nur leicht, er fÃ¼hlt sich auch genauso an und lÃ¤uft sich, besonders bei schnellen km sehr gut. Die Mittelsohle ist nicht zu schmal aber das DNA Loft Material ist super und bietet ausreichend DÃ¤mpfung was nicht zu lasten des Gewichts geht.DÃ¤mpfung: FÃ¼r reine VersenlÃ¤ufer ist der Schuh sicher nicht die beste Wahl, fÃ¼r MittelfuÃŸlÃ¤ufer ist er meiner Meinung nach super. Die DÃ¤mpfung ist ausreichend, man spÃ¼rt die EnergierÃ¼ckgewinnung, wenn auch nicht so sehr wie bei einem Carbon-Schuh (kostet auch wesentlich weniger).Feedback: Die Sohle ist zwar nicht sehr dÃ¼nn, aber sie gibt viel Feedback. So ist der Lauf auf sehr groben Schotterwegen eher gewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig. Auf Trailabschnitten sowie dem Asphalt spielt der Hyperion Tempo seine StÃ¤rken aus. Die Sohle ist sehr haltbar und nach den 150km ist noch kaum Verschleiss an der AuÃŸensohle zu sehen.Die SchnÃ¼rsenkel sind sehr dÃ¼nn und dÃ¼rften etwas kÃ¼rzer sein, selbst mit Runners Knot sind sie meiner Auffassung nach noch einen Tick zu lange.Alles in allem ein hervorragender schuh von Brooks - mit dem sich bei jedem Wetter laufen lÃ¤sst und man lange (+650km) SpaÃŸ haben kann.Sofern die Rezension hilfreich war, freue ich mich Ã¼ber ein Daumen nach oben ;-)",5

They look exactly as shown. They shipped pretty much right away. It didn't take long to receive them. When I got them I tried them on and the ""fit"" but unfortunately even though I ordered these in my size the material that they are made with probably wasn't the greatest choice because I can see the outline of my foot with the shoe on. I can see my toes very easily. So I can imagine if I were to wear them out and about people are going to be able to see the shape of my foot and my toes move while walking. It looks very odd. They are comfortable, the material is comfortable but not a good choice. Probably for anyone. Very lightweight too. I will be returning them and continue to look for another pair.",2

In a shoe store using gauge I have a men's 10-1/2 D (regular width foot) actual size.  I buy size 11- Wide in everything I buy,Skechers,work boots etc.I like to ensure room for expansion and insert foot beds if needed. I bought sof sole gel insoles here on Amazon also.These arrived today, I ordered 11 X-W  They showed on order as 11 4E {?} Length is good,width is slightly snug with or without replacement insoles.

These are authentic, the box was in good condition all labels were on. They feel great when I put them on and I donâ€™t see any signs of them being fake. Even have memory foam type material at the bottom feels good. I have been looking for some nice casual white leather shoes and these slap! I get mad compliments. Iâ€™m buying all these colors and will post the results. I would say that they are slightlyyyy narrow just a little. So if you have fat feet that may effect you. I didnâ€™t let that effect the rating cause I donâ€™t have that problem. Ima do some walking in them if they hurt my feet or somethin Iâ€™ll let yâ€™all know.",5

The Men's Street Encounter series are much better, and the material used also more formal and suitable for smart casual wear. Shoes are overall quite light and easy to wear, but it simply didn't fit my purposes. Would recommend for casual wear though!",4

Adidas,Lifestyle,Women,US 8,382,140,High quality nice shoes for kids,"These are a little fancier than I would send my kid to school in.They are more like a fancy occasion, Sunday church, holiday, or just an â€œI canâ€™t find my sneakersâ€ day (it happens).I was anxious about the â€œslip onâ€ as sometimes this style is actually harder to get on kidâ€™s limp feet as they donâ€™t tend to push their foot in to help you out at all when trying to get the shoes on. I was surprised that my kid could actually get these on all by himself and without any socks to ease the way to boot. Iâ€™m pleased that the elastic panels built in actually stretch enough so the kids can get their foot in.The quality of these is really good. They look and feel like a high quality menâ€™s shoe, just in a mini me, kidâ€™s size. This is a great shoe to match Dad in.My kid was so excited about his new shoes he ran errands around town in them the day he got them.Canâ€™t wait for him to wear these to picture day, etc.Overall Iâ€™d recommend them.",5

Comfortable, my son has no complaints and gives them a big thumbs up3. They look very nice in person, very happy with the style.Cons:1. They are showing very slight signs of wear after a month but to be fair my child is very active.2. The materials used for these shoes arenâ€™t bad but also not high grade either.Overall these are a great pair of shoes. There is a little room for improvement but overall Iâ€™m happy with them and i would definitely get them again.",4
Converse,Casual,Men,US 8.5,"38,839",70,functional and easy to put on!,"I love that these have the utility of a sneaker but can slip on easily without my child needing to tie the shoes or mess with velcro straps!  Very well made, durable child shoe.  My child feels comfortable in them and has never complained about wearing them (he would be barefoot all the time if that were an option). They dry faster than most of his other shoes---which is helpful because he refuses to put on a wet shoe-and I don't blame him!.  Worth the extra expense for its functionality and ease of putting on.",5
Puma,Running,Women,US 7,392,80,Nice casual shoe,"My 6 year old likes these.  They're comfortable and easy to slip on, they have good stretch to fit over his foot.

New Balance,Running,Women,US 9,"4,992",130,Nice quality kid shoe,"Genuine leather is always a plus for any kind of shoes, they're so much more durable.

Easy to slip on and off, and the elastic at the shoe's opening helps with wider feet. Looks great with jeans and little boy khaki pants.",4
